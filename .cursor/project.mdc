This project is leveraging Puppeteer to manipulate the browser for automation purposes.
 - useContext7 to ensure we are following all Puppeteer standards
 - 
## General Conventions

- Use `async/await` for all asynchronous Puppeteer operations.
- Always close `page` and `browser` in a `try/finally` or `afterEach` block.
- Prefer `waitForSelector` over `setTimeout` or `waitForTimeout`.
- Reuse browser/page instances when possible to avoid overhead.

## File & Folder Structure

- Each piece of automationg belongs in the appropriate file in `src/adapters/`
- Use `src/utils/` for shared functions like element selectors or wait wrappers.
- Keep configuration (like launch options) in a `config/puppeteer.js`.
